# Lua File Decryptor 🗝️

Author: Qrexxed

## Requirements 📋
- Java (included in directory)
- Python 3.12+

## Usage 🚀
1. Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed on your system.
2. Run the `main.py` script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
3. A dialog will appear. Select the directory containing the `.lua` files you want to decrypt.
4. The script will decrypt the `.lua` files and replace them with the decrypted versions.

## How It Works ⚙️
The script performs the following steps:
1. Searches for `.lua` files in the selected directory.
2. Decrypts each `.lua` file using the `unluac.jar` tool.
3. Renames and moves the decrypted files back to their original locations.

Enjoy decrypting your Lua files! 🎉
